and total runtime. The release dates of the movies ranges from 1980 to 2020.

An analysis is conducted on the data to look for the strength of correlation among different movie variables. A correlation coefficient that is greater than 0.5 will be
considered to be a significant relationship.

correlation coefficients of 0.74 and 0.61 respectively.
